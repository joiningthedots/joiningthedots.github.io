  <p>If a picture is worth a thousand words, is a visualisation worth a thousand data points? 
    This one day symposium will bring together researchers from a range of disciplines across the 
    sciences and humanities to talk about the ways in which they practice the art and science of data visualisation. 
    Rather than focusing on the research that generates the data, we are inviting presentations that 
    focus specifically on the creation of data visualisations and the questions that they answer - and invite! </p>
  <p>Possible topics include: </p><ul>
  <li>Data management decisions</li>
  <li>Choice of tool </li>
  <li>Visual impact and communication</li>
  <li>How final publication and sharing influence the design process</li></ul><br>
  <p>We encourage presentations that focus on the creation of single visualisation or series of visualisations 
    or that have pushed the boundaries of what may be considered to be data visualisation. Presentations 
    will be 15 minutes in length with time for discussion.</p>
  <p>This symposium will create an occasion on which researchers from anywhere and everywhere on the research spectrum 
    can share whatâ€™s in their data visualisation toolbox, exchange thoughts on effective visualisations, 
    and go away inspired to move beyond bar charts and boxplots and to create compelling visualisations of their data. </p><br><br>
